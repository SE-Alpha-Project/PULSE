 # Getting started
 
Follow these steps to set up and run the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows)
 
 Step 1: 
  Git Clone the Repository 
  
    git clone https://github.com/chaitraleedatar/PULSE.git

Step 2:
   Ensure mongodb is running and execute the below to populate the tables:
   Navigate to the backend folder.

    cd backend

  Once in the backend, go to the `db` folder run:
  
    python insert_event_data.py
    python insert_food_data.py

 Step 3:
   Remain in the backend folder and run the following command to start the server:
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    flask run

 Step 4:
   Navigate to the frontend folder and run the below to start the React app:
    
    cd frontend
    npm install 
    npm start
    
 Step 5:
    Open the URL in your browser:  
      http://127.0.0.1:3000
      
 Step 6:
   Compose and run the docker image:
   
    docker-compose up --build  

#### Note
- Additionally, to utilize the chatbot, you need to have [Ollama](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.2) (with llama 3.2 Model) running locally on your machine. 
- To generate the fitness plan, fetch an API token from Mistral AI
- To fetch the news on resources page, fetch an API token from Newsapi

https://github.com/aditikilledar/burnout-proj3/assets/52149707/5873f399-194b-4a9c-85a4-db05b5c2e438

### Existing Features

### Test Suite
Based on the provided code snippets, here's an overview of the test suite in the project:

1. Frontend Tests:
   - Tests rendering of each of the components, as present in [frontend/src/](frontend/src/) - for Home, Profile, Events, My-Meals, FAQs, Contact-Us etc

2. Backend Tests (`test_api.py`):
   The `APITestCase` class contains multiple test methods covering various API endpoints and scenarios:

   a. Authentication and Authorization:
   - `test_register_success`: Tests successful user registration.
   - `test_unauthorized_get_user_registered_events`: Tests unauthorized access to user's registered events.
   - `test_unauthorized_enrolled_true`: Tests unauthorized access to enrollment status.
   - `test_my_profile_unauthorized`: Tests unauthorized access to user profile.
   - `test_usersEvents_unauthorized`: Tests unauthorized access to user's events.
   - `test_foodCalorieMapping_unauthorized`: Tests unauthorized access to food calorie mapping.

   b. Event Management:
   - `test_get_events`: Tests fetching events.

   c. User Data Access:
   - `test_weekHistory_unauthorized`: Tests unauthorized access to week history.
   - `test_caloriesBurned_unauthorized`: Tests unauthorized access to calories burned data.
   - `test_goalsUpdate_unauthorized`: Tests unauthorized access to goals update.
   - `test_profileUpdate_unauthorized`: Tests unauthorized access to profile update.
   - `test_caloriesConsumed_unauthorized`: Tests unauthorized access to calories consumed data.

The test suite covers the following aspects:

1. Component Rendering: Ensures that key frontend components render without crashing.

2. API Endpoint Security: Extensively tests unauthorized access to various API endpoints, ensuring that protected routes are secure.

3. User Authentication: Tests the user registration process.

4. Data Retrieval: Tests fetching of events and other user-specific data.

5. User Actions: Tests various user actions like updating profile, goals, and accessing personal data.

6. Error Handling: Implicitly tests error responses for unauthorized access attempts.

While this test suite provides good coverage for authentication, authorization, and basic functionality, there are areas that could be expanded:

1. Positive test cases for authorized access to protected routes.
2. More comprehensive frontend testing, including user interactions and state management.
3. Testing of data manipulation endpoints (e.g., creating meals, enrolling in events).
4. Edge cases and error handling for valid but problematic inputs.
5. Integration tests that cover the interaction between frontend and backend.

Overall, the current test suite focuses heavily on security and unauthorized access, which is crucial, but could be expanded to cover more functional aspects of the application.
